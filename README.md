# Arithmetic-Implementation


This repository only contains one class which implements basic arithmetic opatarions such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. The class defines a natural number and sets its coefficients in a LinckedList. The method implements a method for each arithmetic operation using an efficient algorithm, that allow the program to compute large numbers pretty quickly. There are also some extra methods which implement some of the same arithmetic operations using slower algorithms, thus allowing to compare the efficiency of the other method.s
