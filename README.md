# Arithmetic-Implementation

This repository only contains one class which implements basic arithmetic opatarions such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. The class defines a natural number and puts its coefficients in a LinkedList. The method implements an algorithm for each arithmetic operation using an efficient algorithm, that allows the program to compute large numbers in small amounts of time. There are also some extra methods which implement some of the same arithmetic operations using slower algorithms, thus allowing to compare the efficiency of the other methods.
